Introduction to HTML5 Elements
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Example usage, a main element with two child elements nested inside it:

<main> 
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
Note: Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the Applied Accessibility section.

Add Images to Your Website
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.

An example of this would be:

<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg">

Note that img elements are self-closing.

All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.

Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.

Let's add an alt attribute to our img example above:

<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg" alt="A business cat wearing a necktie.">
